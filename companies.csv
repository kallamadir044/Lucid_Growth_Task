,"MindFire, Inc.","WHAT WE DO: If you print Direct Mail, you know that your Clients:

- Demand better response rates & more leads
- Repeatedly ask for new ideas & ways to engage their market (""bring us something new!"")
- Are secretly spending more & more of the print budget on digital ads

You likely also know that it's possible to create Direct Mail campaigns that work WITH digital media for dramatically better results ... but with limited time, staff, & resources, how do you offer these services?

That's where we come in. 


HOW WE HELP: We help Printers solve this challenge so they can offer a new Direct Mail add-on service with healthy margins.

It all starts with adding a Personalized URL (""PURL"") & Personalized QR Code (""PQR"") to the Direct Mail  but that's just the tip of the iceberg. It's everything unseen that makes all the difference.


HOW WE DO IT: You can add these new services to your Direct Mail by having us do all the work (just send us your mail files) or get trained to use the MindFire software to do it yourself.

In either case, our mission is simple: To help you SUPERCHARGE the Direct Mail you offer your Clients.


WITH MINDFIRE, YOU CAN:

1: Add Personalized URLs & Personalized QR Codes to each mailer so that each recipient can respond quickly & easily online

2: When recipients respond online, you display a dynamic Landing Page or Microsite that is personalized & contextualized to each person.

3: The Landing Page or Microsite is designed to covert the response into a Lead

4: As you generate Leads, send them to your Client's CRM & to their sales team in real-time for immediate follow-up

5: Each step of the way, you capture more data about each respondent. This means you have more data for personalized follow-up Emails, SMS, Ringless Voicemail (all powered by MindFire) ... & more print!

,"Mailers Haven","Mailers Haven began in 2004 with a goal to provide data expertise to the reseller market. Since then we have grown the company significantly, expanding our offerings, and making technology, quality and service the core of our business.

We created Mailers Haven specifically for professional mail and print shops, marketing companies and other list resellers. Our customers are sophisticated and knowledgeable list purchasers who demand more  and we give it to them. From experts in list targeting to our best-in-class data quality.

Of course everyone says they have great data, but since we only work with resellers, such as mail shops, printers and ad agencies (and since they purchase often), we need to be especially diligent about our lists. It begins with publishing the quality ratios of every non-specialty list we sell. The accuracy of these ratios is backed by our Mailer Haven Delivery Guarantee, including a commitment to pay out $0.40 per returned mail piece in excess of our guarantee.

Many of our competitors offer a cheap base mailing list, with little or no selects and then charge a fortune for any additional criteria needed for better targeting. At Mailers Haven, we give you the most used selects for free. More selects means better targeting and better results.

We want you to have a leg up on the competition. Thats why were offering to make our technology, yours. With Mailers Havens MySite, you can showcase our ingenious list count and order system on your website, or web-to-print platform. This technology is powerful and easy to use.

At Mailers Haven, we want to give back to our loyal customers. Thats why we developed the Mailers Haven Rewards Program. It allows you to earn rewards simply by purchasing mailing lists at our normal low prices. 

In addition to mailing lists, we offer a wide range of data enhancement services, including 48-Month NCOA, DSF, Consumer and Business appends, email campaigns and appends.","Advertising Services","11-50 employees","Privately Held","Valencia, CA","United States","mailershaven.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/mailers-haven"

We are lead by our clients to create outstanding impact for their ecommerce brands via email marketing, so that they can fully optimise on incoming traffic, instead of simply letting it go to waste.

We dont just stop you from leaving money on the table; we stop you from dropping another dollar, pound, and/or euro. (We work with international brands with a country-focused, segmented approach and have experience with multiple currencies.)

Choosing not to take advantage of extra revenue that could be yours with just a few tweaks is one thing, but throwing it away on a strategy that is completely forgettable to your subscriber list is much worse.

With a worldwide, remote team and our epicentre of operations in London, we are lightyears ahead of the game.

Best of all, we save brands from taking light years to master their own email marketing, and help them to stop dropping money alongside the luxury of dropping zero sweat, since we do everything.

And more.

We will land you beyond the moon, with a sustainable increase in revenue percentage, alongside impactful messaging and design.

,"Scribble Mail","The World Is Changing, Are You Ready To Step Up and Join The Superheroes of Direct Mail?

Consumer attention has drastically changed.

Whereas traditionally, you could send them a mailing and know that its likely to get read - today theyre bombarded with messages competing for their attention from all angles.

This means that sending them yet another boring piece of spammy direct mail DOES NOT work.

As soon as it lands on the doormat, it flies straight into the bin quicker than you can say, Up, up, and away!

It looks impersonal, it looks like a sales pitch and if they have any inkling that its from a company that they havent asked to be mailed from  then it falls on deaf ears.

But at Scribble Mail, were saving the world from poor-performing direct mail.

Thats because, after spending many hours in our secret underground lair, running experiments and planning for world domination  we stumbled upon a potion.

You take your mailing, you drop it in a coloured envelope, you hand-address the envelope and then you send it with a first class stamp.

What this incredible concoction achieves is that your mailing looks personal, it looks real and it looks like it has been sent by an actual person!

This wins the recipients attention, it gets your envelope ripped open and it gets your mailing read (with a level of trust).

This Scribble Mail potion results in industry-high response-rates and recipients that feel cared for (rather than just a line of data on a spreadsheet).

It means that you can burn less data to get the same results or that you can instantly increase your response rate by simply changing to our style of delivery.","Advertising Services","11-50 employees","Public Company","Ashby-de-la-Zouch, England","United Kingdom","scribblemail.co.uk","https://www.linkedin.com/company/scribble-mail"

,"Email Guardian","205 billion emails are sent each day around the world. Thats 2.4 million sent per second, and a staggering 74 trillion sent per year. With the daily figure set to rise to 246 billion by 2019, our preferred form of communication is certainly not showing any signs of slowing down.

When participants in a recent survey in the UK were asked if they had ever sent an email to the wrong recipient, a worrying 70% said yes. And whats more concerning is that the majority admitted to the blunder happening in the workplace.

Email is used daily by major corporations in legal and financial sectors, hospitals, entertainment, human resources, the list is endless. All with a need to share highly sensitive and sometimes personal information in digital format. As this need increases so does the need for cyber security - in a legal firm, sending highly sensitive information to the wrong recipient could cost you your job, the firm's reputation and  legal fees.

Email Guardian was founded in June 2016. Our company designs and sells software to improve the functionality provided by products such as Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, and Gmail. 

Our launching product goes by the same name, and is an email monitoring tool designed to reduce, if not altogether remove the risks of sending emails and sharing highly sensitive information with the wrong recipients.

Are you leveraging emails to generate up to 30% or more of your total revenue?

Email should be your primary marketing channel.

Why?

You already paid to acquire a customer. Why not make the most out of it?
Increase LTV of a customer or AOV. 

Also, if you have a 100% conversion rate from the traffic that FB and Google provide. You don't need to capture leads.

But if you're not, make the most out of the traffic since you're paying a considerable sum.

Capture their email or SMS to convert them to a customer later so that you have the freedom to play & test with the ads.

So, are you taking advantage of the channel that 83% of consumers say they prefer being communicated with from brands? (FYI - that's more than social, push, & carrier pigeon combined).

But you just keep putting it off because it feels like its too big for you to do on your own.

Thats where I come in! Ive been helping small business owners, like you, use email marketing since 2012. In fact, Ive helped hundreds successfully launch a newsletter they LOVE putting together.

Small business owners love working with me. Heres what some of the people Ive helped have said:

We couldnt be happier with our newsletter. Previously, I tried to do it on my own and it took me so much time. Since we have started working together, it is so much easier to concentrate each month on just getting it done, thanks to your reminders and speedy newsletter service!

Working with Minal has shown me that nurturing my email list is invaluable to me. Its been a steep learning curve, but I now have a consistent format and I really understand what my readers like. This, in turn, has helped me give them the content they love, and make sales. It really has been an eye opener.

Without your course, it would have taken me 5 or 6 years to get to anywhere near where I am now with my newsletter. I now have an effective email that people want to read.

Minals Email Marketing Planner is a really useful resource to help me develop my email marketing strategy further. Its clearly and logically laid out with background explanations and planning templates.","Marketing Services","Self-employed","Privately Held","London, England","United Kingdom","marketingbyminal.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/marketing-by-minal"

Experiencing this shortfall in our own business we identified areas where development is needed. We then focused our attention on two main areas, business services and education.

Identifying these two areas helped us to focus on developing the products and services needed and tailored each area to the needs of our clients.

The company then appointed two directors to manage these important areas.

Dave Saunders heads the business section and brings with him years of experience both in IT and business management.

Val Locker is head of our education department. Val brings a vast amount of experience in this area. Her background in banking and managing her own business together with bringing up a young family played key roles in taking the company to a higher level.

These two professionals are forging ahead with new and innovative products and services to help our clients achieve their ultimate goals.","Consumer Services","2-10 employees","Educational","Hackney, London","United Kingdom","markit98.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/markitbusinesssolutions"

Email as it should be. Encrypted. Private. Organized. Spam-free.

StayPrivate is a simple service which anyone can use, both individuals and businesses, to ensure that emails are encrypted and kept safe.

To use StayPrivate as an individual, sign up at stayprivate.com. To use StayPrivate as a business, contact your IT provider or sign up for a free trial at stayprivate.com.

Sending to or receiving emails from personal email accounts is the number one security gap facing both individuals and businesses today. Free personal email accounts are neither private nor secure; using them for important or sensitive communications puts individuals at risk of identity theft and other cybercrimes. Businesses which send or receive important information to or from personal email accounts are failing in their professional duty of care, are in breach of privacy regulations such as GDPR, and put themselves at risk of falling victim to cybercrime - over 70% of successful cyberattacks on businesses involve emails from personal email accounts,
