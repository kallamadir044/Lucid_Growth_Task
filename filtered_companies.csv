Email Guardian,"205 billion emails are sent each day around the world. Thats 2.4 million sent per second, and a staggering 74 trillion sent per year. With the daily figure set to rise to 246 billion by 2019, our preferred form of communication is certainly not showing any signs of slowing down.

When participants in a recent survey in the UK were asked if they had ever sent an email to the wrong recipient, a worrying 70% said yes. And whats more concerning is that the majority admitted to the blunder happening in the workplace.

Email is used daily by major corporations in legal and financial sectors, hospitals, entertainment, human resources, the list is endless. All with a need to share highly sensitive and sometimes personal information in digital format. As this need increases so does the need for cyber security - in a legal firm, sending highly sensitive information to the wrong recipient could cost you your job, the firm's reputation and  legal fees.

Email Guardian was founded in June 2016. Our company designs and sells software to improve the functionality provided by products such as Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, and Gmail. 

Our launching product goes by the same name, and is an email monitoring tool designed to reduce, if not altogether remove the risks of sending emails and sharing highly sensitive information with the wrong recipients.

The product is available for both individual users as well as Corporate Enterprises.",Information Technology and Services,2-10 employees,Privately Held,"Rochester, Kent",United Kingdom,emailguardian.net,https://www.linkedin.com/company/email-guardian
The Email Wizards,"Are you happy with your current email marketing situation?

Are you leveraging emails to generate up to 30% or more of your total revenue?

Email should be your primary marketing channel.

Why?

You already paid to acquire a customer. Why not make the most out of it?
Increase LTV of a customer or AOV. 

Also, if you have a 100% conversion rate from the traffic that FB and Google provide. You don't need to capture leads.

But if you're not, make the most out of the traffic since you're paying a considerable sum.

Capture their email or SMS to convert them to a customer later so that you have the freedom to play & test with the ads.

So, are you taking advantage of the channel that 83% of consumers say they prefer being communicated with from brands? (FYI - that's more than social, push, & carrier pigeon combined).

If you're not sure, let's chat. We help e-Commerce, dropshipping, DTC companies generate up to 30% and possibly more of your revenue from email.

Marketing by Minal,"Does the thought of creating your first email newsletter make you want to run for the hills?

I get it. Trying something new is scary. And putting yourself out there is even worse.

But you know that you need to get started. 

Social media just isnt cutting it for you anymore. 

And besides, you need to start building your own database of contacts. You know, the ones you can communicate with on your own terms.

But you just keep putting it off because it feels like its too big for you to do on your own.

Thats where I come in! Ive been helping small business owners, like you, use email marketing since 2012. In fact, Ive helped hundreds successfully launch a newsletter they LOVE putting together.

Small business owners love working with me. Heres what some of the people Ive helped have said:

We couldnt be happier with our newsletter. Previously, I tried to do it on my own and it took me so much time. Since we have started working together, it is so much easier to concentrate each month on just getting it done, thanks to your reminders and speedy newsletter service!

Working with Minal has shown me that nurturing my email list is invaluable to me. Its been a steep learning curve, but I now have a consistent format and I really understand what my readers like. This, in turn, has helped me give them the content they love, and make sales. It really has been an eye opener.

Without your course, it would have taken me 5 or 6 years to get to anywhere near where I am now with my newsletter. I now have an effective email that people want to read.

Minals Email Marketing Planner is a really useful resource to help me develop my email marketing strategy further.
